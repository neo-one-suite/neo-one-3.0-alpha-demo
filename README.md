# Simple NEOONEDataProvider Script

Use this script to do manual debugging/testing of Neo blockchain data. Just provide the correct RPC URL
to the `NEOONEDataProvider` and then you can use our API to get the data you want from the Neo blockchain.
This could be a private network chain, the TestNet, or the MainNet. Just make sure to change the RPC URL.

Instructions:

- Run `yarn install`
- Change the script as needed
- Run `yarn ts-node index.ts`

To learn more about the available APIs go to https://neo-one.io or look at the source code
at https://github.com/neo-one-suite/neo-one/tree/master/packages/neo-one-client-core.

The script at `index.ts` is just a small sample of what's possible.
